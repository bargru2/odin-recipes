    <p>
      This simple brick-oven pizza recipe has been made famous by several
      well-known, Brooklyn wood-fire pizzerias. Best accompanied by ice-cold,
      pilsner-style lager beer.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/4 cup warm water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 cup cold water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl, then sprinkle yeast
        over the top. Let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in cold water and salt. Stir
        in flour, 1 cup at a time until incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Divide in half and form into two tight dough balls. Coat with olive oil
        and refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16 hours. Be sure to
        use a big enough container to allow dough to rise.
