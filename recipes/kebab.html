    <p>
      This doner kebab is so tasty â€” I'm sure once you try it, you'll want to
      make it again and again! Serve with lightly toasted pita or flatbread,
      chili sauce, and a salad of shredded cabbage, carrot, onion, and sliced
      cucumber. It's easy to make in advance, slice and freeze for whenever you
      get that craving!
